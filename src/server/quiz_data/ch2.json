      "question": "Consider a client and a server, separated by an RTT of 4 time units. The client makes a request for 4 objects at t=0. O1 consists of 10 frames, O2 and O4 each consist of 1 frame, and O3 consists of 2 frames. In the HTTP/2 example shown below, the server is transmitting frames to the client in the order O1, O2, O3, O4 (as long as there are frames of type i to transmit, and when not the server just moves on to a frame from object i+1 mod 4). Each frame takes 1 time unit to transmit. Under HTTP 1.1 (not shown below), the server would send O1, O2, O3, O4 in that first-come-first-served (FCFS) order, sending each object in its entirety before moving on to send the next object in that order. Let's define the object download delay as the time from when an object is requested (at t=0 below) to the time that object is received in its entirety. What is the average object download delay (the sum of the four object download delays divided by 4) under the HTTP/2 object frame transmission order shown below and under HTTP/1.1 O1, O2, O3, O4 object transmission order?",

      "question": "Consider again the scenario shown in the figure above (question 2.2.12a), assuming again that the client and server have not communicated before, that the client knows the server's IP address, and that HTTP 1.1 is being used. Now assume that the client has a browser cache (but there is no web cache). The browser cache is initially empty and all GET request messages have an If-Modified-Since field. The HTTP client: again makes a first GET request to the leftmost server for a base page that it has never before requested; the base page contains a reference to an embedded jpeg object. makes a second GET request for that embedded object. then makes a third GET request (a very short time later TCP connection is still up) for the same embedded jpeg object (with that third GET request having an If-Modified-Since field). Let's focus on just this third HTTP GET request. How many round trip times (RTTs) are needed from when the browser issues the third HTTP GET request, until the reply for that third GET request is received? You should take into account any TCP setup time (if any) required before an HTTP GET is sent by the client, the time needed for the server to transmit a requested object (if any), and any propagation delays (if any)not accounted for in these other amounts of time.",

Consider the following DNS requests, made by the local host at the given times: t=0, the local host requests that the name gaia.cs.umass.edu be resolved to an IP address. t=1, the local host requests that the name icann.org be resolved to an IP address. t=5, the local host requests that the name cs.umd.edu be resolved to an IP address.
