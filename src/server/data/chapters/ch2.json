      "question": "Consider a client and a server, separated by an RTT of 4 time units. The client makes a request for 4 objects at t=0. O1 consists of 10 frames, O2 and O4 each consist of 1 frame, and O3 consists of 2 frames. In the HTTP/2 example shown below, the server is transmitting frames to the client in the order O1, O2, O3, O4 (as long as there are frames of type i to transmit, and when not the server just moves on to a frame from object i+1 mod 4). Each frame takes 1 time unit to transmit. Under HTTP 1.1 (not shown below), the server would send O1, O2, O3, O4 in that first-come-first-served (FCFS) order, sending each object in its entirety before moving on to send the next object in that order. Let's define the object download delay as the time from when an object is requested (at t=0 below) to the time that object is received in its entirety. What is the average object download delay (the sum of the four object download delays divided by 4) under the HTTP/2 object frame transmission order shown below and under HTTP/1.1 O1, O2, O3, O4 object transmission order?",
