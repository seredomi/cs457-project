# Game Tutorial

## Basic instructions

1. Run the client and specify the IP and port that the server is running on
2. If connection is successful, you'll be prompted to either create a game or join a game if one already exists
3. Just follow the prompts from there! The game will start immediately, but you're friends can join in any time.
4. At any point in time, you can press `q` to quit the game. Keep in mind that if you started the game, this will end the game for other players as well.
5. Finally, whether you quit or finish the game, you'll be prompted with the results from the game. If any other players played through all the questions you did, you'll see their results alongside yours.
6. From here, you can cycle back to the main menu and decide to play again or quit.
