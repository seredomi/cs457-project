# Game Tutorial
[Here's a demo](https://youtu.be/cUddLGm4dfw) demonstrating how multiple users can create multiple games and join each other.

## Basic instructions

**Note: not all of this is implemented yet!**

1. Connect to the server
2. You'll be prompted to configure your game session with:
   -  a name for your player profile
   -  a name for the game session
   -  which chapters you'd like to study
   -  how many questions you'd like to take
3. After specifying this, your game will start! To play alone, simply continue answering questions, and you'll receive your results at the end.
4. If you'd like to play with others, they just need to connect to the server after you've created your game. Then they can choose to 'join an existing game'. They can jump in whenever, and leave whenever they want, too. They'll still get results for their session. Keep in mind that the question won't advance to the next one until everyone connected has answered.
5. Afterwards, everyone will get to see each others' results, so you can get competitive with it üë®‚Äçüíª
